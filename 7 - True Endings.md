##Train scene Analysis 
Ending is completely open-ended for viewers to write in at least for now.

### Ending/Train scene Interpretation:
I analyzed this scene in a few different ways.  I think they are all possibilities for viewers depending 
on what ending they feel fits best until Anno constrains it more.

### 3+1 Shinji - a merger of two Shinji with Forward moving time only.
Based on observations it appears that the anti-verse merges with the new world.  
Shinji appears to have natural adult demeanor
I assume that there is a person in the new world that represents a Shinji that grew up healthy with Yui and Gendo.
Thus Shinji's mind and body merged with the one of the new world starting/or following the shinji+mari interaction.
And the story of the new world is the Story of Shinji's life moving forwards now.

Possible Relationships: Asuka, Mari

### 3 to 1 Shinji - 3.0 Shinji is transfered with free time axis 
In this interpretation, we are only constrained to the point in time that we observe Shinji with Mari.  
We are completely free to 
write the back-story and forward-story and facts depending on our interpretations.  
We can explain how Shinji met with Mari and they merged with 3.0 Shinji to get the DSS choker on him which needs to be removed.

Possible Relationships:  Anything with constraints that Shinji knows Mari and they are at least friends at time of train station.

## Notes from Impressions on Watch
### First watch Impression:
I was just happy Shinji can finally be happy.  I really liked his confidence and ability to seize the day.  
Mari and Shinji are surprisingly nice together.  I had the impression that the bidirectional nature of the 
train station meant they were figuratively saying goodbye to Asuka, Rei, and Kaworu of their pasts. 

### First watch Interpretation (1st watch + reanalyzing train scene): New world (1.0) Shinji has already been created and living a life of 28 years.  
Then anti-verse merges with the New world and 3.0 Thrice Shinji merges with 1.0 Shinji.  
In this world, Mari might be a front runner to end up with Shinji simply because she was originally planning to 
meet up with Shinji for a date or to have a fun time.

### bidirectional time interpretation (2nd watch):  The past timeline of this world has yet to be created.  
As humans we are typically used to time moving forwards, but as creative authors we have the ability to create backstory.  
This train station is merely one capture in a point of time and space, which leaves us with almost all freedom to determine what lead up to this and what the future is.  
I imagine when Shinji and Mari are rushing out we are filling in the world for them as the go.  
Therefore, they are in such a rush because they don’t know what kind of presents that we have prepared for them.  
In this interpretation, you can create a future of Shinji with whatever relationships you think best suits the story and your interpretation of RoE overall.


### Observations and Thoughts:
*	Photorealism of the animation style of train station suggests a merger occurred between two worlds (anti-verse (animation) + new world (realistic))
*	Shinji very adult like and comfortable around Mari even going so far as to tease her
*	Shinji references, “Good woman with large breasts”.  This means that he fully recalls past events of 3.0.
	*	Could also suggest that he agrees with Mari’s assertion and sees her in that way.
*	DSS choker + adult 1.0' attire also seems to support this conclusion.
*	Shinji’s comfort in teasing Mari suggests that it is possible that they could be a couple.
*	Alternatively, they could understand each other well enough that this is not an issue for them.
	*	Example 1. a heterosexual female might be more comfortable hanging out with homosexual male in the aspect that the female does not have to worry about the male misinterpreting any of her actions for attraction and thus regulating her actions.
	*	Example 2. Something like a family relationship.  If she is Shinji’s godmother in this timeline for example.  
But their ages and interactions suggest a more equal relationship.
*	The scene has a feeling of excitement and new wonder when Shinji + Mari go out to explore the new world.
*	Opposite side of train station Asuka, Kaworu, and Rei in New world style dress:
	*	Their dress suggests that they are going to be a part of new world, but it is up to viewer to judge
	*	Renders of Asuka Kaworu and Rei are static.  I would suggest that they are waiting for the viewers to bring them to life in the way they imagine.		
	*	Framing them all in a common train station is a future opportunity to bump into one another once again.  
Or perhaps their home and commute is on the same paths.
	*	Alternatively, it could suggest that they are going in different directions as well.
	*	The equality between them suggests that Anno+ is leaving the future relationship ambiguous on purpose and leaving it to the viewer to decide.
*	Notice Mari is roughly the same age as Shinji
	*	Something appears to be wrong with conventional curse of Eva theory, if we assumed that she should age to her real age of roughly 50 now from being Shoujo A with Yui in picture. (14 year old body during RoE). 
*	Shinji is 28 because we wanted to see him as a happy grown adult?
*	When Shinji and Mari leave the train station they step into the real new world of 1.0
