## My non-canonical interpretations of what ideas and concepts represent
You should figure your own interpretations, but you can use these as a guide as a starting point.
If you simply love Evangelion, then you can slowly find out more of the truth for yourself.  But for 
those who are struggling to love Mari and Evangelion, I leave these notes for you.

### Note:
Some of these concepts may deviate from an objective truth, but Evangelion is a simple story about learning 
to connect with others.  As long as you open your heart, appreciate life like Mari, then it will only 
be a matter of wishing to figure out the truth.  To completely figure out the truth for yourself, you 
only need to watch the final scene of `Thrice` and realize what Anno is saying to his fans.  I assume 
you have watched all of NGE+EoE+RoE and are looking to be slightly spoiled if you read after this.

### My thoughts on Evangelion concepts:
Evangelion is a story meant to be understood from our feelings, so I will try to explain concepts in 
a way such that you can focus on simpler understanding.  You may figure out a better understanding as 
we compare understandings and as you rewatch Evangelion.  Don't try to overly focus on these concepts 
for the answers, but instead use them to try to understand the story of the main characters.

### Parallels:
We analyze ourselves by comparing our feelings and actions to those that are like us.   Evangelion constantly 
asks us to compare characters to each other as well as ourselves to other characters to see if there 
is any truth to be learned. 
Evangelion – Dark interpretation:
They are a representation of monsters and the desires of society forced upon us like shackles binding 
our true freedom.  The freedom to be who we wish to be.
Evangelion – Light Interpretation:
Evangelion contain the souls of those that are most dear to us.  Those that would protect us at any 
cost.  They might try to bear the pain of the world on their shoulders or try to hide us from the truth 
to protect us.  We must believe in their pure intentions for their actions.
### Kaworu:
Kaworu is presented as a conception of an ideal version of Shinji who did not choose a “world with complementary”. 
With an origination from a foreign world, it can be difficult for him to understand aspects of a world 
with complementary.  Perhaps meant as a reminder to love your self before you can feel self-worth and connect.
### Nature of the soul
Scholars have had many different interpretations of this.  For humans to exist in the world of Neo-Tokyo, 
their souls must accept the constraints of the world, or the world will reject their existence.  It 
could be postulated that souls could be confined in cores or dummy plugs.  The ability to transfer souls 
to different forms of existence could be mediated by some aspect of the divine, cell culture and growth.
### Purity of the Soul:
A child-like ability to connect with others around them without rejection or judgement.  A child does 
not know how to reject others on birth.
### Synchronization Ratio
The synchronization of the soul of the Eva with the soul of the pilot.  Those of pure soul can pilot 
Evangelion without suffering.  If the purity of soul is high enough, it is possible to pilot any Evangelion 
assuming the soul of the Eva is willing to accept exchange.  Perhaps it is possible that through the 
synchronization of soul that aspects such as emotion, ideas, or even 	██████ can be exchanged.  
Ability to choose Sync ratio could suggest ideas such as the collapse of distance between the souls, 
enlightenment, or divinity.
### Eva pilot damage
When sync ratio is high that is when the pilots have lowered their defenses the most.  To connect with 
others is the ability to get hurt.  And when one is too close a perceived betrayal will hurt the most. 
If the “purity” of your connection is high enough, then you can accept everything about the other person. 
No matter what they do or say you can accept it.  If your soul is strong, you may get hurt, but you 
can easily regenerate.
### Age
You notice pilots are all described to be 14.   This is the age where one is between a child and an 
adult.  A duality of both worlds.  We can ask Shinji to act like an adult to pilot a giant monster. 
Yet we are still at an age where we have aspects of our childhood.  Thus, we can bond with the souls 
of our mothers more easily as illustrated in NGE.

Note: Some ages may not be consistent with timeline and DOB.  Perhaps a way of telling us to not focus 
on the small details to discover the truth.
### Pilot candidates
Those speculated to have the potential to connect closely with the soul of the Eva.  Implies mother-like 
figures were part of Gehirn and willingly gave up their lives/souls for their belief that they could 
save their children or humanity.  They are gathered in school for easier time to protect them.
### AT-Field
The ability to reject others.  Not necessarily a bad thing.  We may need to reject others to define 
our existence on our own terms.
### A reminder 
To explore other aspects of evangelion in NGE that many others have explored in the past to determine 
the truth for themselves.

More exciting secrets to be added in the future!
