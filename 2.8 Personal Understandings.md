# Trying to apply our knowledge of the Concepts of Evangelion to add more flavor to the original story.

##Asuka's self worth
After Asuka starts to show lower pilot sync harmonization ratio test results in the events of NGE, she 
starts to slip more and more.
To understand this, perhaps for a normal person, Asuka's "corrective self-brainwashing" actions might 
have worked and she would have been able to recover. However, in Evangelion her pride and self-identity 
is too strongly linked with being an Eva Pilot (she wants to be stereotypical elite flower of the school). 
 Her actions are a rejection of her Mother and her childhood.  Thus her mother is extremely hurt by 
this and struggles to connect with her.

This creates a negative feedback loop further lowering her sync ratio from which Asuka has a hard time 
to recover.

We must think of ways to break one part of the loop to escape.  In EoE, when Asuka finally feels her 
mother's warmth and unconditional love, that is when she realizes she is not alone.  Her mother is her 
pride and she can be both her mother's little girl and an Eva pilot at the same time.

But then she gets metaphorically gangbanged by MP Eva in a completely rediculous and shocking development. 
 We can save that discussion for another day.

As a viewer, we later come to the realization that Gendo and Fuyutsuki were holding all the keys.  They 
could have told Asuka about her Mother and how to bond and be successful as a pilot.  But instead their 
goal is to get Shinji to wish so strongly for his Mother, so that when Shinji creates the new world, 
they can see Yui again.  So you can see how sick and perverse, Gendo or perhaps Anno is in his treatment 
of Asuka.  She is just a doll for him to play around with just like Ayanami.  Although for Asuka she 
does not share Yui's genetics, so he can be even more callous.
