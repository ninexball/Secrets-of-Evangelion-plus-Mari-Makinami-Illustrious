===========================
Anti-verse / Negative World
===========================
Appears to juxtapose our reality with Eva world.  This is where the world of Eva is created.  It suggests 
enormous power to change reality within the Movie and even alter the laws of physics/Eva.  Has vibes 
of instrumentality when "Rei" functions as a mediator in EoE.

======================
The Nature of Words
======================
Humanity has lost the divinity in the power of words.  As humans discover sin, they learn to twist the 
true meaning of words to harness them for evil and thus their true words and true origination is lost 
as it drifts to adapt to human nature.  With the true nature of words lost by humans, humans must
always question the truth/understanding of words from others.  Otherwise, one may find oneself betrayed 
by their own expectations of their meaning despite pure intentions.

We must should attempt to discover ways to understand people without relying only on words.  When we remove all
human falsity from words, what remains is the truth of the world.

Wunder
=======+
A divine magic.  Something beautiful.  For me a child, Wunder was the magic that brought Studio Ghibli 
worlds like Totoro alive.  
There may be some small hints to the nature or source of wunder hidden in the world.  But one does not 
need to see everything to know the truth because the truth has always been inside of you.

=========
Science
=========
Science is humanity’s way of describing the world based on logic, predictions, and experimentation. 
 Some aspects of wonder can be difficult to define in terms of science and human understanding.  Instead 
of trying to explore the world through the Science of Evangelion Scientists, try to synchronize your 
souls with those imprints of the soul that the creators and staff left on Evangelion.  It is much easier 
to understand and see beauty in the world in that manner.

========
Labels
========
We can often think of ourselves in terms of labels so that we can be like others.  To Asuka being an 
Eva pilot is a source of enormous pride.  Thus, to be lumped together with plain Shinji at the start 
of NGE was a source of conflict.  She wants him to get cooler for the status of Eva pilots to rise or 
to stop embarrassing her.
- These labels can form a key part of one’s identity.  
- There are also others that refuse to be defined by themselves or the world
When we assign labels to others in attempt to understand them, we may not capture their true essence. 
 It is unclear whether the human interpretation of the terminology “angel” is what the “angels” would 
use to define themselves or the truth of their existence.
To discover the rest of evangelion’s secrets we must look at the final hint Anno left for us the very 
last scene.  To search for Mari’s true identity is like opening Pandora’s Box.
