# Secrets-of-Evangelion-plus-Mari-Makinami-Illustrious
真希波 マリ イラストリアスの正体、エヴァンゲリオンの追加メッセージの秘密が明らかに!

My truth of the events of Rebuild of Evangelion and the truth behind Mari Makinami.  I'll attempt to slowly share more, and let people discover the secrets of Rebuild of Evangelion (RoE) with as much help as they need.

Please don't spoil the fun for every unless they also wish to know the secrets.
For more fun, solve most of the mystery for yourself here: [initial tweet](https://twitter.com/Supasleepaman/status/1498560837920899074)

I find that the best way to understand Evangelion is through the core message first.  Then we can add additional modules or layers to the work.  So this is an attempt to deconstruct the Eva philosophy in terms of my simple understanding.  I hope that you can take things to build your own core message that you get from Evangelion.

For me the core message is about humans, understanding themselves, their needs, and their relationships with other people.  This is my attempt to unify my understanding of the message starting from Neon Genesis Evangelion (NGE) to End of Evangelion (EoE) to RoE and explore what aspects they have in similar and discuss some of their divergences.

Starting from 1, I'll slowly cover what I think are the themes or concepts of Evangelion.  We will cover first a basic understanding and then slowly go into deeper themes. 
Starting from 2.1, I'll start adding a glossary of items to describe my personal impression of aspects of the anime like who the characters represent and how they interact with each other.
Starting from 3, I'll start to reveal what I would say is the secret of the world, and eventually we will get to Anno's last message to his true fans.

Please do not take ideas without linking to tweet or this page, Thanks!
