## How to read.  You can look at the raw version if text wrapping is an issue atm.
* Starting from 1, I'll slowly cover what I think are the themes or concepts of Evangelion.  We will cover first a basic understanding and then slowly go into deeper themes. 
* Starting from 2.1, I'll start adding a glossary of items to describe my personal impression of aspects of the anime like who the characters represent and how they interact with each other.
* 3, is some tips to help see the secret of the world in my opinion only
* 4+5 are spoiler heavy and some speculation

### Notes
I find that the best way to understand Evangelion is through the core message first.  Then we can add additional modules or layers to the work.  So this is an attempt to deconstruct the Eva philosophy in terms of my simple understanding.  I hope that you can take things to build your own core message that you get from Evangelion.

For me the core message is about humans, understanding themselves, their needs, and their relationships with other people.  This is my attempt to unify my understanding of the message starting from Neon Genesis Evangelion (NGE) to End of Evangelion (EoE) to RoE and explore what aspects they have in similar and discuss some of their divergences.

I know for some with language and culture barrier it may be harder to understand Evangelion.

Hopefully, Ukrainian Fans and others around the world will be able to see NGE+EoE+RoE in One Piece
