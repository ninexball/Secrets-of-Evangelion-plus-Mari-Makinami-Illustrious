We can't make sense of some things mathematically. An allusion to whether we think of glass half full or it being half
empty.  With what kind of spirit does Anno and Studio Khara wish for you to be able to approach anime, culture, and life?
When I think of it that way, I feel like I can see through the complete truth of the world and Anno and all the staff's
pure intentions and reasons for developing the story this way.

I think we should show appreciation for them even if some may not like all the aspects of Evangelion.
It doesn't need to be perfect for us to love it and for it to have a great impact on our life.

Some Thanks

Anno, for bringing us this story with so much of your life.  It has helped me put my life into perspective when
I look at cast esp Shinji to understand parts of myself.
Hikki - Grown up with so many of your songs like Exodus and Heart station.  Your work to that helped to bring Kingdom Hearts
 and Evangelion even more alive and real.  Thanks for letting the world know some of the beauty of the Japanese language
 and bridge some of the distance between us.
Everyone that worked to bring us the Asuka beach scene and Village 3 esp Rei Q, so that Shinji could find some peace in the world.
It was truly beautiful.
